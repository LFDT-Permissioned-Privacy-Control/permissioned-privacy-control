-- WHAT: the projection barrier stops exempting key-only writes to group_access
-- rows whose credential a reviewed groups document declared.
-- WHY: 077 lets an UPDATE that changes only rpc_api_key (and updated_at) pass,
-- so an operator can rotate an operational key on a managed stream. Since 080
-- a document may declare the credential (rpc_api_key_source IS NOT NULL);
-- the same exemption would let a legacy writer that raced the first activation
-- overwrite the declared ciphertext while the row still says "declared". The
-- exemption now applies only when the row's credential is operational.
-- Projection writes carry the ops.configuration_projection marker and are not
-- affected; the rotation endpoint already refuses declared rows.
-- AFFECTED ROWS: none rewritten. Detection of writes this now refuses: errors
-- containing 'use a configuration revision for managed groups state'.
-- AUTHORITATIVE RECORD: the reviewed groups revision (configuration_revisions)
-- plus its transactional audit; this migration writes no audit rows.
-- EXPAND-ONLY / ROLE SEPARATION: replaces one function body in place; every
-- trigger created by 077 keeps pointing at it. Grants are unchanged.
