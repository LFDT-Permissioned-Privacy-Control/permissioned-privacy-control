// Resolver.ResolvePermissions correctly refuses to publish into the shared SQL
// cache when an invalidation commits mid-compute. But AccessController then
// copied the very same permissions into its in-memory (or Redis)
// PermissionCache unconditionally, so the revoked grant stayed usable for the
// full TTL anyway — the exact fail-open outcome RD-1267 exists to prevent.
// The original tests drove Resolver directly and so never observed that
// second write.
//
// These tests drive AccessController.resolvePermissionsForRequest, which is
// the site that performs the second write, and assert on the controller's own
// cache.
