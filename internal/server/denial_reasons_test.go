// TestWireReason_ClosedAllowlist is the core RD-1137 Part A security test: the
// wire layer must only expose caller-own-fact reason codes and must collapse
// every oracle-sensitive (and every unknown/future) code to the generic value.
// A failure here means the verbose channel leaks cross-org/existence state.
//
// Every Reason* constant in denial_reasons.go MUST appear in exactly one of the
// two buckets below. Go can't enumerate consts by reflection, so when you add a
// new Reason*, add it here too — the test then forces a conscious safe-vs-
// collapse classification (mirrors wireReason's closed-allowlist intent).
