// Curated denial-reason codes (RD-1137).
//
// These are STABLE, tenant-facing identifiers for why a request was denied.
// They are written to access_logs.denial_reason (always, for the org-scoped
// admin Access Logs panel — RD-1137 Part B) and, for opt-in verbose callers,
// returned on the wire (RD-1137 Part A).
//
// Rules:
//   - Stable: external automations may switch on these once Part A ships, so
//     treat the string values as an API contract — add, don't rename.
//   - Tenant-safe: a code may only describe a fact about the caller's OWN
//     request. Codes that could reveal another tenant's state are marked
//     ORACLE-SENSITIVE below; the wire path (Part A) collapses those to a
//     single generic value. The access-log column always stores the precise
//     code (the admin view is already org-scoped, so it's safe there).
//   - Never derived from raw internal/DB error text.

// Collapsed on purpose (do NOT add to the allowlist without a security review):
//   - cross_org, tracing_unavailable, trace_depth_exceeded: the trace runs
//     AFTER the entry-point access check on the top-level target, then walks
//     internal frames the caller can steer via calldata. Distinguishing these

//     existence oracle (the exact RD-915/RD-934 class). They stay precise in
//     the access-log column (org-scoped admin view), generic on the wire.
//   - deploy_claim_required, compliance_blocked, internal_error: not currently
//     exposed; collapsed conservatively until individually reviewed.
