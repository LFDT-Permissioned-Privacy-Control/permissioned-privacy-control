# What moved to the DSL, what did not, and where the configuration should live

Three pages, for the decision. Everything behind it — per-endpoint lists,
examples of every document, the evidence for each argument, the table inventory
and the log of what was checked — is in
[api-migration-details.md](api-migration-details.md).

One word used throughout: a **principal** is the authenticated OPS identity that
acts — a person (their DID) or a service account. It is not a wallet address:
two principals may link the same Ethereum key, and the chain cannot tell them
apart.

## 1. In one paragraph

Six classes of configuration are now authored as **reviewed documents** instead
of direct API calls: execution rules, group definitions, the contract registry,
compliance settings, approvers, and platform items. Thirty-two write endpoints
close behind them: once a stream has an active revision they answer 409, and a
database trigger refuses a direct write. Each stream is edited through the same
eight calls — read context, list revisions, submit, read one, simulate,
activate, activate through CI, withdraw (the platform stream has seven: no CI
activation). Everything about **people** stays an
operation on its existing endpoint: accounts, memberships, address links, bans,
KYC. Those are produced by events and proofs, not authored by anyone.

**What "reviewed" means mechanically.** Writing a draft and putting it into
force are separate acts by separate people. OPS refuses an activation by the
person who submitted the draft. Whoever activates must be a full organisation
administrator, not banned, and a current member of an admin group named in that
organisation's active approvers document. Until that document exists, any full
administrator qualifies. The check runs inside the activation transaction, so
authority is read at the moment of activation rather than taken from the
request. Trusted continuous integration is the one exception: a signed manifest
naming the repository, the commit, the exact drafts and the approvers stands in
for the second person, because the pull request was the review.

## 2. What moved

| Stream | What the document holds | Endpoints it replaces |
|---|---|---|
| `execution-rules` | which group may call which function, argument bounds, nested-call rules, deploy rights — compiled and enforced by the node on every call frame | the function half of contract grants, plus the three RD-1287 policy endpoints |
| `groups` | group definitions: admin flags, RPC method allowlist, claims | create, update, delete, group access, batch delete |
| `contract-registry` | contracts, ABI, visibility flags, read grants and event rules | contract create/update/delete, ABI, visibility, claim, sync-delete, batch-move, grants |
| `compliance` | thresholds, currency, enforce or monitor, and each token's entry — symbol, decimals, and either the price-feed id to use or a fixed price | compliance config, token entries, address thresholds |
| `approvers` | which admin groups may activate a revision, and which CI is trusted | none — new |
| `platform` | shared infrastructure, tenants (organisations to follow) | Azure tenants, shared infrastructure |

Thirty-two write endpoints in total. Their `GET`s keep working, as reads of the
projection.

**What happens to the admin screens.** When a revision is activated, the
server writes its contents into the same database tables the admin screens have
always read. Groups, Contracts and Compliance therefore keep working as they
are. New groups and contracts show up as normal rows. Nobody has to rebuild
those screens.

Editing is what changes. Once a stream is managed by a document, the old edit
and delete calls are refused. Until this branch the screens did not know that:
the buttons stayed, the call failed, and the administrator was told something
untrue — deleting a group reported that the group might still have members.
The screens now ask the server whether the stream is managed, go read-only
when it is, and otherwise show the server's refusal word for word (RD-1295).

One caution about "if it all lives in Git, we can drop the admin UI". The
configuration screen is not a text box. Someone other than the author has to
press activate, and that screen is where they do it. Drafts that belong
together, in different streams, have to be activated in one go. Before
approving, that person needs to see the diff the server computed, try the
candidate against the node, and check whether the node has picked up the last
change. All of that is work the server does on request. None of it can be
written into the document being approved.

## 3. What did not move, and why

One reason each. The full argument and its evidence are in the details
document.

One principle first, because it cuts across several rows: **for a control that
blocks someone — a ban, a sanctions entry — the data class does not decide the
approval mode, the situation does.** A curated list or a planned offboarding
can be reviewed, because a second person can check the basis. An incident
cannot wait for one. Both modes are legitimate and an organisation should be
able to choose. The design consequence is the same either way: a class that
supports both needs provenance on its rows, so re-applying a reviewed document
never undoes what an operator did immediately. Sanctions already carry that
field; bans do not.

| Class | Why it is not a document |
|---|---|
| People: accounts, memberships, address links, KYC | none of it is authored. An account appears at login, KYC comes from the credential, a link is the user's own signature, and a membership is an instance of a rule reviewed elsewhere — the tenant mapping in the platform document — written by three writers at per-person cadence. (The credential path for memberships acts on claims the proof never covers: RD-1291) |
| Bans on a principal | an incident ban must take effect before anyone can review it. A planned deactivation could be reviewed, but `users.banned` has no provenance field, so a re-applied document would lift an incident ban |
| Live exchange rates | a feed: rates land in `system_token_prices` on a timer and are resolved at check time; the document only says which feed a token uses |
| Sanctions list | operational **today**, but this depends on who produces it: a list the customer curates from OFAC designations is a decision and belongs in a document; a vendor feed is not. `sanctioned_addresses` already records `source`, so both can coexist — see the decision below |
| Deployment records | an observation: the receipt names the signing address, and two principals may share one. Only OPS knows which of them submitted the transaction, because the submission carried its authenticated identity |
| Disclosure | every step is the other organisation's answer |
| Secrets (group RPC credential) | the value must never appear in a text that is diffed, reviewed and exported. The document may name the environment variable that holds it, in the organisation's own namespace; activation resolves and encrypts the value, and a variable that is not set refuses the activation |
| Caches, sessions, permission results | recomputed or re-issued; never a source |

The rule behind the table: **anything that makes a decision must be the document
and nothing else** — that is what closing thirty-two endpoints achieved. What
stays an operation is written by *events*: a login, a directory, a finalized
receipt, a price feed. Making those documents too would either put an approval
inside the login path or have machines self-activate revisions, which removes
the review and keeps the conflict, since two documents declaring a complete
state overwrite each other exactly as a document overwrites a row. One place
still breaks the rule and is on the list below: `refresh-codehash`. The
deployment auto-grant no longer bypasses anything — both deployment paths now
register through the authorised transaction, and the next registry revision
adopts the rows as drift — but whether it should exist at all once the rules
express it (`targetClass: deployer`) is still open.

## 4. Where the document text should live

**Recommendation: the customer's Git.** The pull request is the review. This
already works: `activate-ci` accepts a signed manifest binding the repository,
ref, commit, the exact candidate digests and the reviewers who approved.

- **Push, not pull.** CI or an ArgoCD-style agent calls the API. No read credentials into the customer's repository, and enforcement never waits for Git to be reachable.
- **OPS writes three things at activation**, and they are the only reason the database is involved: the fact-version pin the node switches to, the activation record (who, when, which digest), and the projection tables for as long as they exist.
- **Activation is not the same as enforcement.** This is how the branch implements it today, not a decision anyone has signed off. After activation, OPS sends the compiled policy and the facts it is evaluated against to the node, signed. The node trusts what it was sent for the fact lifetime, thirty seconds by default (`OPS_NODE_POLICY_FACT_TTL`), and OPS re-sends every second by default (`OPS_NODE_POLICY_PUBLISH_INTERVAL`). So a reviewed change is live about a second after approval. If OPS stops sending, the node's copy goes stale and it refuses transactions rather than enforcing old rules.
- **Facts never come from Git.** A reconcile loop over people would delete memberships the directory created and lift bans set during an incident.
- **Two streams stay human.** `approvers` and `platform` refuse a service principal at both submit and activate (`configuration_revision_store.go:85,439`): they decide who may approve and what the platform trusts, so CI must not be able to widen its own authority there. Their text can live in Git; a person has to push and activate it.

This is the split GitOps already uses: Git holds desired state, the target
system holds applied state. Kubernetes keeps it in etcd; OPS keeps it in
Postgres.

**Where each piece physically sits.** The document text is
`configuration_revisions.source` in the `privacy_proxy` database, with its
`digest` in the column beside it; a trigger forbids changing either after the
row is created. What the server derives from that text — for execution rules,
the generated contract, its bytecode and hashes — goes into
`compiled_artifact`, another column of the same row. Nothing derived is ever
written back into the document text, and nothing is ever pushed back to Git.
The reviewed text and the derived evidence sit side by side and are
re-checked against each other at activation.

**A document can pin an observed value, but something must produce it.** This
is the real limit of "put everything in the configuration", and we already have
it in three places. A rule pins `abiDigest`, the sha256 of the exact registered
ABI text — and no endpoint returns that digest, so the author computes it by
hand and gets "re-derive the policy against the current ABI" when it is wrong.
A platform entry pins `codehash`, and the endpoint that computed it is now
closed by the stream guard (below). By contrast `legacyRestrictionDigest` is
done correctly: the context hands the author the value to paste
(`migration.legacyRestriction.policyDigest`).

The rule to follow when moving anything else into a document: **moving a field
into a document does not remove the observation, it moves the duty to the
author.** If the API does not publish the observed value, configuration-first
turns into hand-computed hashes and silent mismatches.

**File layout: one file per `(organisation, stream)`.** It matches the
activation unit, keeps review ownership where it belongs, and a change to one
stream does not force a review of the others. A single global file is
disqualified for a multi-tenant deployment: one repository would put every
customer's configuration in front of every reviewer. The full comparison is in
details §8.

## 5. Decisions this needs

**1. Git as the authoring home, and the file layout.** Recommended above: the
text in the customer's Git, pushed in by CI, one file per
`(organisation, stream)`.

**2. Does OPS keep a copy of the applied text?** Assumed yes. It is the only
way the operator can answer "what was in force at T" without the customer's
repository, and the only way projections can be rebuilt from history. Saying no
is a data-sovereignty choice with those two consequences.

**3. Organisations into the platform document.** Decided in principle; needs
the deletion semantics and last-administrator protection.

**4. `refresh-codehash` lost its read along with its write.** A
shared-infrastructure entry is trusted only while the bytecode at that address
hashes to the pinned value, and this endpoint both observed the chain and wrote
the pin. The pin now belongs to the platform document, so the stream guard
closes the whole call. Refusing the write is right — a freshly observed hash
must not become a trust anchor without review. Refusing the read is not: it was
the only thing that produced the value, and hand-computing it wrongly drops the
address out of shared infrastructure silently. Keep it as a read, drop the
write. Detail: details §16.

**5. Should a curated sanctions list be a document?** It depends on who
produces it. A list the customer's compliance team maintains from OFAC
designations is a decision, and Git review fits it; a vendor feed is not, and a
revision per update would be theatre. Both can coexist —
`sanctioned_addresses` already records `source` — with two caveats: a document
is capped at 1 MiB, about ten thousand addresses with reasons, and
`users.banned` has no provenance field, so reviewed deactivations cannot be
separated from incident bans until it does.
